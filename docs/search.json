    "text": "Solution\n\n1. The accumulation of policy reserve in the 1st year is \\[[0+G(.6)](1.1)-1000q_{x}=p_{x}\\cdot(16.84)\\]\nIf we knew the value of \\(q_{x}\\), we could find G. Using the recursive relationship for net reserve for the 1st year, we have \\[[0+80](1.1)-1000q_{x}=p_{x}(40)\\]\n, and solving for \\(q_{x}\\) results in \\(q_{x}=.05\\). Then \\[.6G(1.1)-1000(.05)=(.95)\\cdot(16.84)\\rightarrow G=100\\]\nAnswer: A\n\n2. We use the recursive reserve relationship \\[({}_{k-1}V+\\pi)(1+i)-(b_{k}-{}_{k}V)\\cdot q_{x+k-1}={}_{k}V.\\]\nAt time 0, \\({}_{0}V=0\\), and at time 2 when the policy ends, \\({}_{2}V=0\\) since this is a term insurance. For the first year \\((k=1)\\), since \\(b_{1}=1000+{}_{1}V\\), we have \\[\\pi(1.08)-1000(.1)={}_{1}V \\text{, so that } {}_{1}V=1.08\\pi-100\\]\nThen, for the second year, \\(b_{2}=2000+{}_{2}V\\), so that \\[(1.08\\pi-100+\\pi)(1.08)-2000(.1)=0.\\]\nSolving for \\(\\pi\\) results in \\(\\pi=137.1\\).\nAnswer: A\n\n3. Let S denote the aggregate present value random variable of the N annuities. \\[S=\\sum_{j=1}^{N}W_{j}\\] where each \\(W_{j}=500Y\\) and Y is the PVRV for a life annuity-due of 1 per year. Then \\[E[Y]=\\ddot{a}_{x}=\\frac{1-A_{x}}{d}=\\frac{1-.369131}{.06/1.06}=11.1454\\] , and \\[Var[Y]=\\frac{1}{d^{2}}\\cdot[^{2}A_{x}-(A_{x})^{2}]=12.8445.\\]\nThen, \\(E[W]=500E[Y]=5572.7\\) and \\(Var[W]=500^{2}\\cdot Var[Y]=3,211,125\\). \\[E[S]=N\\cdot E[W]=5572.7N\\] , and from the independence of the lives, \\[Var[S]=N\\cdot Var[W]=3,211,125N.\\]\nWe want the initial fund amount F so that \\(P[S\\le F]=.90\\). Applying the normal approximation, we get \\[P\\left[\\frac{S-5572.7N}{\\sqrt{3,211,125N}}\\le\\frac{1,429,440-5572.7N}{\\sqrt{3,211,125N}}\\right]=\\Phi\\left(\\frac{1,429,440-5572.7N}{\\sqrt{3,211,125N}}\\right)=.9\\]\nFrom the normal table, we get \\[\\frac{1,429,440-5572.7N}{\\sqrt{3,211,125N}}=1.28\\]\nWe can solve a quadratic equation for N, or try each possible answer to find \\(N=250\\).\nAnswer: C\n\n4. \\(L=\\) PVRV benefit - PVRV premium. The later that the death occurs, the smaller the PV of benefit and the larger the PV of premium received. The median value of L, say \\(L_{m}\\) would satisfy \\(P[L\\le L_{m}]=.5\\). If we find the point \\(t_{m}\\) for which \\({}_{t_{m}}p_{70}=.5\\), and then find the issue-date loss \\(L_{t_{m}}\\) based on death at exact time t, then \\(L\\le L_{t_{m}}\\) is equivalent to \\(t\\ge t_{m}\\), which has probability .5.\nFrom the table, \\(l_{70}=91,082.4\\). In order to have \\({}_{t}p_{70}=.5\\), we must have \\(\\frac{l_{70+t}}{91,082.4}=.5\\) so that \\(l_{70+t_{m}}=45,541.2\\). From the table we see that \\(l_{89}=45,995.6\\) and \\(l_{90}=41,841.1\\). Using linear interpolation, we see that under UDD we have \\(t_{m} \\approx 89.109\\).\nThe issue date loss if death occurs at age 89.109 (19.109 years after issue) is $100,000v^{19.109}-1600_{|.05}=26,391$. This is the median of L.\nAnswer: D\n\n9. \\(_{2|}A_{[60]:\\overline{2}|}=v^{3}\\cdot{}_{2|}q_{[60]}+v^{4}\\cdot({}_{3|}q_{[60]}+{}_{4}p_{[60]})\\). \\[{}_{2|}q_{[60]}={}_{2}p_{[60]}\\cdot q_{[60]+2}=p_{[60]}\\cdot p_{[60]+1}\\cdot q_{[60]+2}=(1-.09)(1-.11)(.13)=.1053\\] \\[{}_{3|}q_{[60]}={}_{3}p_{[60]}\\cdot q_{63}=p_{[60]}\\cdot p_{[60]+1}\\cdot p_{[60]+2}\\cdot q_{63}=(1-.09)(1-.11)(1-.13)(.15)=.1057\\] \\[{}_{4}p_{[60]}=p_{[60]}\\cdot p_{[60]+1}\\cdot p_{[60]+2}\\cdot p_{63}=(1-.09)(1-.11)(1-.13)(.85)=.5989\\] \\[_{2|}A_{[60]:\\overline{2}|}=.7224\\]\nAnswer: D\n\n10.

Then, \\(\\alpha(2)=\\frac{id}{i^{(2)}d^{(2)}}=1.000316\\) and \\(\\beta(2)=\\frac{\\alpha(2)-1}{d^{(2)}}=.258984\\). Then, \\(\\ddot{a}_{x}=\\frac{\\ddot{a}_{x}^{(2)}+\\beta(2)}{\\alpha(2)}=10.2557\\) and \\(A_{x}=1-d\\ddot{a}_{x}=.3112\\). Finally, under UDD, \\(\\overline{A}_{x}=\\frac{i}{\\delta}\\cdot A_{x}=\\frac{.0720}{ln(1.072)}\\cdot.3112=.322\\).\nAnswer: D\n\n11.

The original net premium is based on the original insurance value. \\(\\$1000P_{60}=\\frac{1000A_{60}}{ \\ddot{a}_{60} } = \\frac{1000A_{60}}{(1-A_{60})/d} = \\frac{1000(.36933)}{(1-.36933)/(.06/1.06)}=33.145.\\)$\nThe expected loss at issue is \\[APV\\ benefit - APV\\ premium=1000A_{60}'-33.145 \\ddot{a}_{60}'=1000A_{60}'-33.145\\left(\\frac{1-A_{60}'}{d}\\right)=114.3.\\]\nIt follows that \\(A_{60}'=.44140\\). Therefore \\[A_{60}=.36933=vq_{60}+v(1-q_{60})A_{61}\\] and \\[A_{60}'=.44140=v(10q_{60})+v(1-10q_{60})A_{61}\\]\nSince there is no change in mortality from age 61, we get \\[A_{61}=\\frac{.36933-vq_{60}}{v(1-q_{60})}=\\frac{.4414-10vq_{60}}{v(1-10q_{60})}\\]\nThis results in a quadratic equation for \\(q_{60}\\), which we can solve. Alternatively, we can “guess and check” to find that \\(q_{60}=.01376\\).\nAnswer: D\n\n13. \\(R=(1-.05)\\times(1-.08)\\times(1-.12)\\times(1-.2)=.95\\times.92\\times.88\\times.8=.61529\\). \\(q(x,C)=.05\\), \\(q(x+1,C+1)=q(x+1,C)\\times(1-\\phi_{x+1})=.08\\times.9=.072\\). \\(q(x+2,C+2)=q(x+2,C)\\times(1-\\phi_{x+1})^{2}=.12\\times.9^{2}=.0972\\). \\(q(x+3,C+3)=q(x+3,C)\\times(1-\\phi_{x+1})^{3}=.2\\times.9^{3}=.1458\\). \\[S=(1-.05)(1-.072)(1-.0972)(1-.1458)=.67987\\] \\[\\frac{R}{S}=.905\\]\nAnswer: E\n\n15. Let \\(p=1-q\\). \\[\\ddot{a}_{x:\\overline{10}|}=1+vp_{x}+v^{2}{}_{2}p_{x}+\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot+v^{9}{}_{9}p_{x}=1+vp+v^{2}p^{2}+\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot+v^{9}p^{9}=\\frac{1-v^{10}p^{10}}{1-vp}\\] \\[A^{1}_{x:\\overline{10}|}=vq_{x}+v^{2}{}_{1|}q_{x}+\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot+v^{10}{}_{9|}q_{x}=vq+v^{2}pq+\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot+v^{10}p^{9}q\\] \\[=vq[1+vp+v^{2}p^{2}+\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot+v^{9}p^{9}]=vq\\left[\\frac{1-v^{10}p^{10}}{1-vp}\\right]\\] \\[P^{1}_{x:\\overline{10}|}=\\frac{A^{1}_{x:\\overline{10}|}}{\\ddot{a}_{x:\\overline{10}|}}=vq\\]\nUsing the recursive formula for reserves, \\((_{k-1}V + P)(1+i) - q_{x+k-1}b_k = p_{x+k-1} {}_{k}V\\). For \\(k=1\\): \\((0+vq)(1+i)-q(1)=p\\cdot {}_{1}V \\implies q-q = p\\cdot {}_{1}V \\implies 0=p\\cdot {}_{1}V \\implies {}_{1}V=0\\). Same equation continues for \\(k=2,3,...,9\\) so \\({}_{k}V=0\\) for all k.\nAnswer: A\n\n18. \\(G\\cdot\\ddot{a}_{35:\\overline{40}|}=.25G+200+.1G a_{35:\\overline{39}|}+50 a_{35:\\overline{39}|}+200,000 A_{35:\\overline{40}|}+200A^{1}_{35:\\overline{40}|}\\). \\[G=\\frac{150+50\\ddot{a}_{35:\\overline{40}|}+200,000A_{35:\\overline{40}|}+200A^{1}_{35:\\overline{40}|}}{.9\\ddot{a}_{35:\\overline{40}|}-.15}\\]\nBut \\(\\ddot{a}_{35:\\overline{40}|}=\\frac{1-A_{35:\\overline{40}|}}{d}=15.4663\\), and \\(A_{35:\\overline{40}|}^{1}=A_{35:\\overline{40}|}-A_{35:\\overline{40}| \\quad \\rceil} = .047971 \\rightarrow G=1876.78\\). Net premium = $200,000 A_{35:|} / _{35:|} = 1610.58$. Expense loading \\(= G - P^{net} = 266.20\\). Using the recursive relationship for expense reserves, we have \\[(_{0}V^{e} + G - e_0)(1+i) - e_1 q_{35} = p_{35} {}_{1}V^{e}\\] \\[(0 + 1876.78 - (0.25 \\times 1876.78 + 200))(1.06) - 200(0.001223) = (1-0.001223){}_{1}V^{e} \\implies {}_{1}V^{e}=-427.94\\] and \\[(_{1}V^{e} + G - e_1)(1+i) - e_2 q_{36} = p_{36} {}_{2}V^{e}\\] \\[(-427.94 + 1876.78 - (0.10 \\times 1876.78 + 50))(1.06) - 200(0.0012735) = (1-0.0012735){}_{2}V^{e} \\implies {}_{2}V^{e}=-424.1\\]\nAnswer: B\n\n19. We use the following general relationship: \\[{}_{m}V=\\pi\\cdot\\ddot{s}_{\\overline{m}|}-\\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}q_{x+k}\\cdot(1+i)^{m-k-1}\\cdot(b_{k+1}-{}_{k+1}V)\\]\nFor an endowment policy, the reserve at the time of endowment is equal to the endowment amount. In this case, we have \\({}_{30}V=500,000\\). The premium is payable for only 20 years, so in the right hand side of the expression, \\(\\pi\\cdot \\ddot{s}_{\\overline{m}|}\\) is replaced by \\(\\pi\\cdot \\ddot{s}_{\\overline{20}|}\\cdot(1+i)^{10}\\) (this term is the accumulated premium to the time of endowment using interest only). The expression becomes \\(\\$500,000=\\pi\\cdot s_{\\overline{20}|}\\cdot(1+i)^{10}-\\sum_{k=0}^{29}q_{35+k}\\cdot(1+i)^{30-k-1}\\cdot(b_{k+1}-{}_{k+1}V).\\)$\nSince \\(b_{k+1}={}_{k+1}V\\) for \\(k=0,1,...,28\\), and \\(b_{30}=0\\) (no death benefit in year 30) and \\({}_{30}V=500,000\\), the summation simplifies. All terms in the sum are zero except for the last one, at k=29. \\(\\$500,000=\\pi\\cdot \\ddot{s}_{\\overline{20}|}\\cdot(1+i)^{10}-q_{64}\\cdot(1+i)^{0}\\cdot(0-500,000)\\)$\nWith \\(i=.04\\) and \\(q_{64}=.02\\), solving for \\(\\pi\\) results in \\(\\pi=10,689\\).\nAnswer: E"
